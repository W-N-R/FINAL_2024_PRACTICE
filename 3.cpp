////A grocery store offers discounts based on the total weight of items purchased.For
////purchases over 10 kg, there is a 10 % discount.For more than 20 kg, the discount is 20 %,
////and for more than 30 kg, it is 30 % .If the purchase amount exceeds $200, there is an
////additional 5 % discount.Write a program to compute the total cost before and after the
////discount.
